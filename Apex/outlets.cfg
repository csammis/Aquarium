    If Time 04:00 to 04:02 Then OFF
Notes:
    My Apex uses an Airport in AP Extension mode to connect to our
    home's main access point. Reset Airport once a day because it
    has been randomly coming unpaired to the AP, preventing Fusion
    from seeing it, and a power cycle corrects that.

Notes:
    Eheim Skim350 surface skimmer set to run 4x a day for an hour
    each time. The autofeeder dumps at 20:00 (or 21:00 if I forget
    to adjust for DST) which gives the tank plenty of time before
    the skimmer kicks on and sucks anything left floating.

    Fallback OFF
    Set OFF
    If Sw1 CLOSED Then ON
    Defer 000:30 Then ON
    Min Time 030:00 Then OFF
Notes:
    Sw1 is a standard float switch set up so that it is closed when
    the float is at the bottom of the stem (opposite end of the wire).
    `Defer` makes sure the switch is closed for 30 seconds continously
    to prevent triggering based soley on wave motion. `Min Time` is
    maybe the worst named keyword in the Apex system. This statement
    keeps the outlet in OFF for a mimimum of 30 minutes before it can
    be set to ON again.
